The Tunnel class represents a room in the game with an active or inactive tunnel. The tunnel can be activated or deactivated, and when the hero enters an active tunnel, they are transported to a new location. The class provides methods for activation, deactivation, displaying the room details, and displaying sensory information about the tunnel.
The test class contains test methods to verify the correct generation of a tunnel room, the functionality of deactivating a tunnel, and the behavior of a pit room in different scenarios. These tests help ensure the proper functioning of the related game classes.
